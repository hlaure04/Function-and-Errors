# Functions and Errors

## Description
**This project involves writing a smart contract in Solidity that implements the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. These statements are crucial for error handling in smart contracts. They help ensure that conditions are met before executing functions, and if not, they revert the state changes and provide an error message.

The contract includes a token system with `mint` and `burn` functions. The `mint` function allows an address to create new tokens, while the `burn` function allows an address to destroy tokens. Both functions implement the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements to handle errors and ensure the integrity of the transactions.**
